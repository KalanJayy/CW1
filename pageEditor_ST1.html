                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            In HTML,
                            <br><br>
                            div id="splash-screen": This container is the central element for the splash screen. It serves as the wrapper for all the visual elements and ensures they are properly aligned and displayed at the center of the screen.   <br><br>
                            img src="logo.png" alt="": The image tag is used to display the logo of the website. The alt attribute provides an alternative text for the image, improving accessibility. <br><br>
                            div class="loader": This empty div is used to create a loader animation, which serves as a visual cue while the splash screen is active. <br> <br>
                            <br>
                            In CSS, <br> <br>
@keyframes gradientBG: This defines a smooth gradient animation that shifts the background color of the splash screen, creating a dynamic visual effect. The gradient background covers a large area (400% by 400%) and animates between different colors to grab attention. <br><br>
@keyframes fadeInOut: This animation controls the fading effect of the splash screen. It starts with the screen invisible, fades it in, and then fades it out after a short duration, creating a smooth transition to the main content. <br> <br>
.loader: The loader creates a rotating animation using the @keyframes spin rule. It is styled with two pseudo-elements (:before and :after) to create two circular borders, one of which rotates to form the spinning animation. <br> <br>
@keyframes showContent:This animation ensures that after the splash screen fades out, the main content gradually appears, enhancing the transition between the splash screen and the website's core content. <br> <br> <br>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>

                            alt Attribute for Images: The logo image should have an alt text for screen readers (e.g., alt="Good Health and Well Being Logo").br
Layout and Navigation: Flexbox centers the content, making it easy to navigate using both keyboard and mouse. <br>

Animation: Animations are subtle and slow (4 seconds), giving users time to read content without causing discomfort. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p> 
                            The volunteer page is designed with a user-friendly layout, using HTML and CSS for structure and styling. The page includes a navigation menu with links to various pages such as 
                            the homepage, user profile, feedback, and more. It utilizes the flexbox layout to ensure content adapts to different screen sizes. The cards displaying the volunteering opportunities 
                            use responsive design principles and include images, brief descriptions, and flags of the respective countries. Each card has hover effects to make the interaction more engaging, implemented
                             using transform: scale() for a subtle zoom effect. A dropdown menu allows users to sort volunteer opportunities by categories like country, time period, and others. The ratings section is 
                             implemented using both a star rating system and progress bars, visually representing the reviews. The page also features a review list, where users can read feedback from others. The emojis selector
                              is interactive, and users can express their feedback with simple emoticons. The feedback section allows users to input suggestions and submit them. The overall design ensures a smooth scrolling experience
                               through the use of scroll-behavior: smooth and an optimized scrollbar design for aesthetic purposes. <br> <br>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p> 
                            Accessibility is a top priority in this volunteer page. The page ensures that users with visual impairments can navigate smoothly. All images are provided with alt text to describe the content,
                             such as program images and country flags, ensuring screen readers can interpret them. The color contrast is maintained high enough to be readable by individuals with low vision, following the WCAG 
                             guidelines. The dropdown menus are accessible through hover interactions and are easy to navigate, making it simple for users to sort volunteer opportunities. All interactive elements such as buttons
                              and links are clearly labeled, and the page uses proper HTML semantic tags to provide structure for screen readers. The use of flexbox ensures a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, 
                              making the site easily navigable on mobile devices. Additionally, the emoji selector and feedback form are designed with interactive elements that respond to user input, enhancing usability for those with 
                              different interaction needs. Finally, the use of clear labels and large buttons helps users with motor impairments navigate the site easily. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p> 
                            The Content Page was structured using semantic HTML elements like section and article for better readability and organization. Internal navigation was implemented with anchor links to enable smooth 
                            scrolling throughout the page. A fixed-position "Go-to-Top" button was added for quick navigation. For responsive design, CSS Grid Layout was used to adjust the page layout on different screen sizes. 
                            Accessibility features include ensuring a proper heading order from h1 to h6 and providing descriptive link texts instead of generic phrases like "Click here." The page passed validation with minor 
                                warnings due to missing alt attributes on some images
                        </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Alt Attributes: Provided for all images to support screen readers. <br>
                            Semantic HTML: Good use of header, footer, and main tags to enhance structure.

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        One major difficulty was ensuring consistent styling across different browsers,
                         as some CSS properties behaved differently. Debugging these inconsistencies taught me t
                         he importance of using CSS resets and testing on multiple browsers. Another challenge was 
                         designing a visually appealing layout without JavaScript. By learning flexbox and grid, I was
                          able to create a responsive design efficiently. This experience emphasized the importance of clean,
                           organized code and a mobile-first approach in web development.
