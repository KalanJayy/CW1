                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            This webpage consists of an HTML form designed for collecting feedback from users visiting a website. The form includes several sections that collect personal details, feedback on user experience, and additional requests, along with some optional interactive elements. <br><br>
                            1. HTML Structure: <br>
                            •	The page uses the html tag to define the document's structure, and it specifies that the document is in English (html lang="en"). <br>
                            •	The head section includes metadata for character encoding (UTF-8), viewport settings for responsiveness, a link to an external CSS file (style.css), and an internal style block for additional CSS rules.  <br>
                            •	The body section contains the content visible to users, including the feedback form.
                            <br><br>
                            o	Personal Details Section: <br>

                            	Ease of Navigation: Another pair of radio buttons to assess if the website was easy to navigate and informative. <br>
                            	Suggestions: A textarea field where the user can suggest improvements if they answered "No" to the navigation question. <br>

                            	An input field for uploading files, supporting common file types like .png, .jpg, .pdf, etc. <br>
                            •	The form is wrapped within a div class="container" which ensures proper alignment and spacing of form elements. <br>
                            •	When the user submits the form, the information is sent to a PHP file (upload.php), indicated in the file upload section's action attribute <br>
                            •	The form includes validation for required fields, such as name, email, telephone number, and date of visit, by using the required attribute on those respective fields. <br>

                            <br><br><br>

                            2. CSS Styling:
                            o	Background and Layout: The background color of the body is dark gray (#333333), while the form container has a gradient background. The form is centered in the middle of the screen, with some padding and a box shadow for a clean and modern look. <br>
                            o	Text Styling: The headings (h2, h4) are styled in green color, making them stand out. <br>
                            o	Form Fields: Various form elements such as inputs, selects, and textareas are styled with padding, margins, and border-radius for a smooth and user-friendly appearance. <br>
                            o	Buttons: The submit button is styled with a green background and white text. On hover, the background color changes to a darker green. <br>

                           <p>
                                •	The use of clear, descriptive labels (label) ensures that screen readers can effectively read the form elements. <br>
                                •	The form also uses placeholder text in input fields and textareas to help guide the user. <br>
                                •	The radio buttons and checkboxes are grouped using div elements with the class radio-group and styled to ensure they are easy to select. <br>

                        <p>
                            The HTML document creates a Team Page that showcases team members with a focus on providing detailed information on hover. The page uses a combination of semantic HTML elements, CSS styling, and a responsive grid layout to ensure a clean and organized form <br> <br>

                            Team Member Section: <br>
                            •	Displays four team members in a grid layout with hover effects to reveal additional information. <br>

                            •	The info section (div class="info") becomes visible on hover, showing the member's name, role, student ID, and skills. <br> <br>
                            Image Handling: <br>
                            •	Uses img tags with a defined width and height of 250px x 300px. <br>
                            •	Images have descriptive alt attributes to improve accessibility. <br>
                            <br> <br>
                            CSS & Styling: <br>
                            •	The page includes two external stylesheets <br>
                            •	Uses class-based styling for better modularity and maintainability. <br>
                            •	Potential hover effects are applied via CSS, possibly using the :hover pseudo-class. <br>
                            •	Flexbox/Grid Layout: Likely used for team member alignment and responsive design. <br>
                            •	Hover Effects: CSS transitions or transforms are used to reveal the .info section. <br>

                            •	Alt Attributes: Provided for all images to support screen readers. <br> 
                            •	Semantic HTML: Good use of header, footer, and main tags to enhance structure. <br> <br>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p> 
                            The Content Page was structured using semantic HTML elements like section and article for better readability and organization. 
                            Internal navigation was implemented with anchor links to enable smooth scrolling throughout the page. A fixed-position "Go-to-Top" 
                            button was added for quick navigation. For responsive design, CSS Grid Layout was used to adjust the page layout on different screen sizes.
                             Accessibility features include ensuring a proper heading order from h1 to h6 and providing descriptive link texts instead of generic phrases like "Click here." 
                             The page passed validation with minor warnings due to missing alt attributes on some images
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Image Sizing and Consistency: <br>
                        Maintaining consistent image dimensions while ensuring images did not become stretched or distorted was a challenge, particularly with varying image aspect ratios. <br> <br>
                        Hover Effects Using Transitions: <br>
                        Learned how to use CSS transition properties to create smooth animations, improving the overall user experience. <br> <br>
                        Testing on Multiple Devices: <br>
                        Testing the page on both desktop and mobile devices highlighted layout issues early, leading to better cross-platform compatibility. <br> <br>
                        Form Validation: <br>
                        Implementing both client-side and server-side validation to ensure all required fields were filled out correctly.Utilized HTML required attributes and proper input types <br>
                        <br>
                        Handling Multi-Select and Checkboxes: <br>
                        Displaying multi-select options and allowing users to choose multiple pages visited.Implemented multiple and size attributes on select elements and ensured all checkbox inputs had unique name values. <br>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p> The feedback form collects user opinions and suggestions, maintaining relevant and appropriate content. 
                        Language used in labels and placeholders is professional and clear.  Label tags with for attributes improve screen reader
                         compatibility. Semantic HTML elements (fieldset, legend, textarea) enhance accessibility.  High contrast between text and
                          background colors improves readability. Limited file types (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf, .doc, .docx) to avoid risky uploads. </p>
