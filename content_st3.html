                    <p class="content-paragraph">
                        Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope
                     with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work 
                     well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of 
                     health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities 
                     to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. 
                     Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, 
                     community and socio-economic development.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a 
                     complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the 
                     next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very 
                     different social and clinical outcomes.

                    <h1>Determinants of mental health</h1>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">
                        Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional 
                         skills, substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable 
                         to mental health problems.
                         <br><br>
                         Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and 
                         environmental circumstances – including poverty, violence, 
                         inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s 
                         risk of experiencing mental health conditions.
                         <br><br>
                         
                         Risks can manifest themselves at all stages of life, but those that 
                         occur during developmentally sensitive periods, especially early 
                         childhood, are particularly detrimental. For example, harsh parenting 
                         and physical punishment is known to undermine child health and 
                         bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.

                    <p class="content-paragraph">
                        class="paragraph">Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects a person’s mood, energy, activity and thought and is characterized by manic (or hypomanic) and depressive episodes.
                         An estimated 40 million people live with bipolar disorder worldwide.
                         In 2019, approximately 1 in 150 adults (40 million people, or 0.53% of the global population) were living with bipolar disorder (1). The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.

                        Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health condition

                                 — either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may

                                 uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Most people who
